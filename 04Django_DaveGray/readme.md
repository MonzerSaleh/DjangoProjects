# Notes

I assume the following

- you have some web development experience, otherwise the why behind many of the steps may seem arbitrary when they are anything but.
- you have python installed, and know your way around the language
- you have an IDE installed
  - Jupyter does not qualify as an IDE, VS Code, Pycharm etc do
  - I highly recommend VS Code as it is one of the most popular editors
  - there are also thousands of extensions & add-ons that make life easy.
- you're familiar with the command line on your machine
  - you know how to install using pip from the command line

```
> python manage.py createsuperuser
monz      monz        superuser
manymonz  1234monzer  **
monz3     manymonz
```
