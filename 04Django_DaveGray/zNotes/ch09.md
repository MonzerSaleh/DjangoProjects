# Chapter 9 - User Registration Form

Source Code

- https://github.com/gitdagray/django-course/tree/main/lesson09

## 01 - Form

1. First we alter the view such that it uses the built in Django UserCreationForm

- we also pass the form class to the template

```python
from django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm

def registration(request):
    form = UserCreationForm()
    return render(request, 'users/registration.html', {"form": form})

```

2. Next we alter the template to display the form

- {% csrf_token %} this is a small piece of protection.
- it embeds a token so that a submission from some other website isn't allowed

```html
<form class="form-with-validation" action="/users/registration/" method="post">
  {% csrf_token %} {{ form }}
  <button class="form-submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

At this point you should be able to see your form. despite the lack of css it will submit but it won't save
adding the save code is our next step

3. Saving the form logic - add the following to your view

- this will create/validate/save the FormClass

```python
if request.method == "POST":
    form = UserCreationForm(request.POST)
    if form.is_valid():
        form.save()
        return redirect("posts:list")
else:
    form = UserCreationForm()
```

4. give it a test.

- create a user
- verify the new user using the admin panel > Users

and that's all for today
