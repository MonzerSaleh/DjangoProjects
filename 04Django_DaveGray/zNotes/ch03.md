# Chapter 3 - Models and Migrations

At this point we assume you have a simple yet functional web app, built along the previous chapters.

The code for this section

- https://github.com/gitdagray/django-course/tree/main/lesson03/myproject

Just a quick reminder:

1. Ensure you are using the same env from the previous chapter, and that it is active. Otherwise you may get bizarre errors such as django not found
2. Ensure you're terminal is inside the project directory.

## 01 - Models

In this section we will look at the models file in the posts app.  
the reference documentation can be found here

- https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/ref/models/fields/

We begin by filling out the posts > models.py file.

1. go to https://github.com/gitdagray/django-course/blob/main/lesson03/myproject/posts/models.py

- and copy the contents into the models.py file
- this class defines the data model. What this means is that it is the representation in code of a table in the database.

2. Next we need to migrate this change to the database.

```
> py manage.py makemigrations
> py manage.py migrate
```

- the first line creates the migration code
- the 2nd line applies the migrations to the database
- any time you add, or change, a model you'll need to run both to ensure your code and database accurately reflect each other.
