## 01 - Uploading Images

Our goal is to be able to upload images

1. we begin by adding to the settings.py file

```python
MEDIA_URL = 'media/'
MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR,'media')
```

2. Next we need to edit the project urls.py

```python
from django.conf.urls.static import static
from django.conf import settings

# Place below urlpatterns variable
urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL, document_root=setting.MEDIA_ROOT)
# this will pull the variable from the settings file so we don't need to define a second time
```

3. next we install pillow into the project (it helps with the image uploads)
4. next we add an image field to the Post Model

```
banner = models.ImageField(default='fallback.png', blank=True)
```

fallback.png can be any image you want to use as the default

5. we need to make and run/apply the migration scripts using the commands
6. At this point you should be able to upload images to your posts using the admin page

- so give it a try before we move forward
- also note that there should now be a media folder at the top level of your folder. This would have been created automatically, by os.path, when the first image was uploaded

7. Now finally we need to incorporate the new image into the Post display page.

```
    # place the following into post_page.html
    <img class="banner"
        src="{{ post.banner.url }}"
        alt="{{ post.title }}"
      />
```

You may also want to add some styling in style.css

```
.banner{
    display: block;
    width: 100%;
    max-width: 150px;
}
```

give a try again and pat yourself on the back!
